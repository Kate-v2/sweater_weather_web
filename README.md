## How to Use
This app obtains/submits data through the [Sweater Weather API](https://sweater-weather-api-app.herokuapp.com/) ([repo](https://github.com/Kate-v2/sweater_weather)). Currently, this is a one page website, utilizing Javascript for all interactions to change displays and make HTTP GET/POST/DELETE requests from the API.

A user can register/login and will have the ability to save forecast locations to their favorites, for easy viewing and access later.
